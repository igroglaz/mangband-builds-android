<body>
<h1>MacOS MAngband Client</h1>
<p>This is a MacOS version of the MAngband Client. This is what you need in order to connect to and play on a MAngband server.</p>

<p>This short Readme file does not provide detailed documentation of how to play. If you are new MAngband your first port of call should be <a href="http://www.mangband.org">www.mangband.org</a>.  Be sure to checkout <a href="http://www.mangband.org/help/">the documentation section</a> of the website</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>Drag and drop the "MAngbandClient" application to the "Applications" folder of your Mac.</p>

<h2>Connecting to a Server</h2>

<h3>Q. How do I connect to a server?</h3>
<p>From the Applications folder, run <i>MAngbandClient</i>.  Several windows will open up, in the main game window (the one at the top left) a list of servers will be displayed.  Press the letter corresponding to the server you wish to connect to.  New players should almost certainly connect to the official "mangband.org" server, which will be the first item on the list.  For example, if the server list looked like this:</p>
<pre>
  a) mangband.org
  b) variantserver.mangband.org
  c) death.to.morgoth.net
</pre>
<p>You would press <code>a</code> (a lowercase "a") to select the official mangband.org server.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>

<h3>Q. How do I configure my display settings?</h3>

Locate and edit your <b>config file</b>. Search for [SDL] part and
adjust the <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>, <i>fullscreen</i> and other
parameters accordingly.

<h3>Q. All the windows which open are very small and squashed in the top left of the screen.  Can I make them any bigger?</h3>
<p>Yes.  Depending upon your screen resolution the default setting of the MAngband windows may be too small.  If it is you can make the windows bigger by choosing a bigger font for each one.</p>

<p>Hold a terminal with a mouse and press the TAB button on your keyboard. This will cycle through available fonts.</p>

<p>You can also edit fonts in the <b>config file</b>.</p>

<h2>Config</h2>

<p>Your <b>config file</b> is located at <code>$HOME/.mangrc</code>. For example, if your username is "panda", your config file is 
located at:

<p><code>/Users/panda/.mangrc</code></p>

<p>Config file is useful for changing several display settings among
other interesting things.</p>

<p>Your pref files are located at <code>$HOME/Library/Application Support/MAngband</code>, so for all users named "panda", that would be:</p>

<p><code>/Users/panda/Library/Application Support/MAngband</code></p>

<p>You don't normally need to edit the pref files, but if you're an 
experienced Angband player, familiar with the format, you can squeeze 
some customizations out of them.</p>
